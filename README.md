#  HealthCare-Project

This project focuses on healthcare data analysis using machine learning techniques to assist in early disease prediction, risk assessment, and data-driven decision-making.

##  Objective

To develop a predictive model that can:

- Analyze patient health records
- Predict the likelihood of certain diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease)
- Assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients early

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Folder Structure

- `Datasets/` â€“ Raw and processed healthcare datasets
- `notebooks/` â€“ EDA, model training, and evaluation notebooks
- `models/` â€“ Trained machine learning models (if applicable)
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview

##  Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

##  Future Scope

- Integration with real-time healthcare data APIs
- Building a web-based dashboard for prediction
- Deploying model via Flask or Streamlit
