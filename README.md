#  HealthCare-Project

An AI-powered healthcare system that combines machine learning, appointment scheduling, and chatbot assistance to enhance patient care and healthcare workflow efficiency.

##  Objective

To build an intelligent healthcare system that enables:

-  Online appointment scheduling with doctors
-  AI-based chatbot for patient queries and symptom checks
- Disease prediction using machine learning models
-  Data-driven risk profiling and decision support for doctors

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL 

##  Folder Structure

- `Datasets/` ‚Äì Healthcare datasets used for training
- `notebooks/` ‚Äì EDA, training, and evaluation notebooks
- `appointment/` ‚Äì Modules for scheduling and booking
- `chatbot/` ‚Äì Scripts or integration code for AI chatbot
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project overview and usage

##  Features

- Appointment scheduling with time slot management
- Chatbot interface for answering patient FAQs and symptom triage
- Disease prediction models (e.g., diabetes, heart disease)
- Clean UI and backend for managing patients and appointments
- Scalable for clinics, hospitals, and remote care systems

##  Future Enhancements

- Voice-enabled chatbot support
- Real-time doctor availability
- Secure user authentication and role-based access
- API integration with wearable health devices
 
## üìÅ Datasets

All datasets used in this project are **self-created** and curated specifically for healthcare use cases. They are structured to support:

-  Machine Learning tasks such as disease prediction and patient risk profiling
-  Chatbot training for understanding common patient queries, symptoms, and medical terminology
-  Appointment-related workflows including doctor availability and scheduling patterns

These datasets reflect realistic healthcare scenarios and are tailored for research, development, and educational purposes within the scope of this project.
